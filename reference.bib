    abstract = {Mixture priors provide an intuitive way to incorporate historical data while accounting for potential prior-data conflict by combining an informative prior with a noninformative prior. However, prespecifying the mixing weight for each component remains a crucial challenge. Ideally, the mixing weight should reflect the degree of prior-data conflict, which is often unknown beforehand, posing a significant obstacle to the application and acceptance of mixture priors. To address this challenge, we introduce self-adapting mixture (SAM) priors that determine the mixing weight using likelihood ratio test statistics or Bayes factors. SAM priors are data-driven and self-adapting, favoring the informative (noninformative) prior component when there is little (substantial) evidence of prior-data conflict. Consequently, SAM priors achieve dynamic information borrowing. We demonstrate that SAM priors exhibit desirable properties in both finite and large samples and achieve information-borrowing consistency. Moreover, SAM priors are easy to compute, data-driven, and calibration-free, mitigating the risk of data dredging. Numerical studies show that SAM priors outperform existing methods in adopting prior-data conflicts effectively. We developed R package “SAMprior” and web application that are freely available at CRAN and www.trialdesign.org to facilitate the use of SAM priors.},

abstract = {The power prior has been widely used in many applications covering a large number of disciplines. The power prior is intended to be an informative prior constructed from historical data. It has been used in clinical trials, genetics, health care, psychology, environmental health, engineering, economics, and business. It has also been applied for a wide variety of models and settings, both in the experimental design and analysis contexts. In this review article, we give an A-to-Z exposition of the power prior and its applications to date. We review its theoretical properties, variations in its formulation, statistical contexts for which it has been used, applications, and its advantages over other informative priors. We review models for which it has been used, including generalized linear models, survival models, and random effects models. Statistical areas where the power prior has been used include model selection, experimental design, hierarchical modeling, and conjugate priors. Frequentist properties of power priors in posterior inference are established, and a simulation study is conducted to further examine the empirical performance of the posterior estimates with power priors. Real data analyses are given illustrating the power prior as well as the use of the power prior in the Bayesian design of clinical trials. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = {Historical information is always relevant for clinical trial design. Additionally, if incorporated in the analysis of a new trial, historical data allow to reduce the number of subjects. This decreases costs and trial duration, facilitates recruitment, and may be more ethical. Yet, under prior-data conflict, a too optimistic use of historical data may be inappropriate. We address this challenge by deriving a Bayesian meta-analytic-predictive prior from historical data, which is then combined with the new data. This prospective approach is equivalent to a meta-analytic-combined analysis of historical and new data if parameters are exchangeable across trials. The prospective Bayesian version requires a good approximation of the meta-analytic-predictive prior, which is not available analytically. We propose two- or three-component mixtures of standard priors, which allow for good approximations and, for the one-parameter exponential family, straightforward posterior calculations. Moreover, since one of the mixture components is usually vague, mixture priors will often be heavy-tailed and therefore robust. Further robustness and a more rapid reaction to prior-data conflicts can be achieved by adding an extra weakly-informative mixture component. Use of historical prior information is particularly attractive for adaptive trials, as the randomization ratio can then be changed in case of prior-data conflict. Both frequentist operating characteristics and posterior summaries for various data scenarios show that these designs have desirable properties. We illustrate the methodology for a phase II proof-of-concept trial with historical controls from four studies. Robust meta-analytic-predictive priors alleviate prior-data conflicts ‘ they should encourage better and more frequent use of historical data in clinical trials.},

abstract = {Including historical data may increase the power of the analysis of a current clinical trial and reduce the sample size of the study. Recently, several Bayesian methods for incorporating historical data have been proposed. One of the methods consists of specifying a so-called power prior whereby the historical likelihood is downweighted with a weight parameter. When the weight parameter is also estimated from the data, the modified power prior (MPP) is needed. This method has been used primarily when a single historical trial is available. We have adapted the MPP for incorporating multiple historical control arms into a current clinical trial, each with a separate weight parameter. Three priors for the weights are considered: (1) independent, (2) dependent, and (3) robustified dependent. The latter is developed to account for the possibility of a conflict between the historical data and the current data. We analyze two real-life data sets and perform simulation studies to compare the performance of competing Bayesian methods that allow to incorporate historical control patients in the analysis of a current trial. The dependent power prior borrows more information from comparable historical studies and thereby can improve the statistical power. Robustifying the dependent power prior seems to protect against prior-data conflict.},

However, this is typically a difficult task since it amounts to integrating over all model parameters. The aim of the paper is to illustrate how this may be achieved by using ideas from thermodynamic integration or path sampling. We show how the marginal likelihood can be computed via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on modified posterior distributions for each model. This then allows Bayes factors or posterior model probabilities to be calculated. We show that this approach requires very little tuning and is straightforward to implement. The new method is illustrated in a variety of challenging statistical settings.},

abstract = {The elicitation of power priors, based on the availability of historical data, is realized by raising the likelihood function of the historical data to a fractional power δ, which quantifies the degree of discounting of the historical information in making inference with the current data. When δ is not pre-specified and is treated as random, it can be estimated from the data using Bayesian updating paradigm. However, in the original form of the joint power prior Bayesian approach, certain positive constants before the likelihood of the historical data could be multiplied when different settings of sufficient statistics are employed. This would change the power priors with different constants, and hence the likelihood principle is violated. In this article, we investigate a normalized power prior approach which obeys the likelihood principle and is a modified form of the joint power prior. The optimality properties of the normalized power prior in the sense of minimizing the weighted Kullback–Leibler divergence are investigated. By examining the posteriors of several commonly used distributions, we show that the discrepancy between the historical and the current data can be well quantified by the power parameter under the normalized power prior setting. Efficient algorithms to compute the scale factor is also proposed. In addition, we illustrate the use of the normalized power prior Bayesian analysis with three data examples, and provide an implementation with an R package NPP.}

    abstract = {Simulating from distributions with intractable normalizing constants has been a long-standing problem in machine learning. In this letter, we propose a new algorithm, the Monte Carlo Metropolis-Hastings (MCMH) algorithm, for tackling this problem. The MCMH algorithm is a Monte Carlo version of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It replaces the unknown normalizing constant ratio by a Monte Carlo estimate in simulations, while still converges, as shown in the letter, to the desired target distribution under mild conditions. The MCMH algorithm is illustrated with spatial autologistic models and exponential random graph models. Unlike other auxiliary variable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Møller and exchange algorithms, the MCMH algorithm avoids the requirement for perfect sampling, and thus can be applied to many statistical models for which perfect sampling is not available or very expensive. The MCMH algorithm can also be applied to Bayesian inference for random effect models and missing data problems that involve simulations from a distribution with intractable integrals.},
